  <p>The Red Pines Café</p>
  <p>The Red Pines Café sits quietly between two concrete giants, its faded sign glowing soft against the hum of Night City. The letters buzz, not sharp like the neon all around, but warm — almost tired, like they've been glowing for too many years.

Inside, the air is thick with the smell of strong coffee and something sweeter, a trace of cherry and vanilla that clings to the booths and wood-paneled walls. The lamps don't match, the tables wobble, and the jukebox always seems to find the right song even when no one touches it.

The regulars here don't change much. The detective with the faraway eyes in the corner booth, the quiet couple at the window, the barista who always hums along to static on the radio. They aren't unfriendly, just… settled, like part of the furniture.

It's a place that feels unhurried, tucked away from the city's constant noise. Hours pass differently here. Sometimes you forget the rain outside, or how long you've been nursing your coffee.

The pie is always cherry. The coffee is always hot. And for reasons no one quite puts into words, people keep coming back.</p>
